The IBA Internship Portal is a web application built with Streamlit that allows IBA students to manage their internship search and reviews. The application integrates with Firebase for user authentication and data storage, enabling a seamless experience for tracking applications, submitting reviews, and managing profiles.

Overview
This portal is designed to help IBA students by providing the following features:

User Authentication:
Students can log in using their IBA email addresses. Registration is available for new users, with email verification links generated by Firebase. A "Forgot Password" feature is also included.

Profile Management:
Users can complete and update their profile information (e.g., full name, age, current semester, program, expected graduation year). The portal ensures that only verified IBA email domains are allowed.

Data Tracking:
The portal enables students to:

Track their internship applications, including details like company name, application status, deadlines, and referrals.

View key performance indicators (KPIs) such as total applications, rejected applications, and applications in progress.

Review & Rating System:
Users can submit and edit internship reviews that include ratings, assessments, interview details, stipend ranges, and outcomes. Reviews can be upvoted or bookmarked by other users, fostering a community-driven feedback system.

Onboarding Process:
New users must complete an onboarding process by submitting at least two reviews. This helps populate the review section and ensures meaningful contributions from every student.

Real-time Data Management:
Firebase Firestore is used to store user profiles, applications, contributions, bookmarks, and reviews. The app automatically syncs data and updates the UI based on user interactions.

Interactive UI with Streamlit:
The portal leverages Streamlitâ€™s components (forms, tabs, buttons, data editor, and sidebars) to create an interactive and user-friendly interface. Custom CSS styling is applied for a modern look and feel.
